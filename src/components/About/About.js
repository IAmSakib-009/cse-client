                    <p>A pet is a domesticated animal that lives with an individual or family. There are
                        popular, well-known pets like dogs and cats. Alternatively, there are less
                        common pets sometimes called exotics such as snakes, turtles, and iguanas.
                        Whether a pet is common or exotic, it can offer pleasure and joy to a
                        household.</p>
                    <h2>10 Characteristics of Pets</h2>
                    <p>What makes an animal a pet? For example, we know there are snakes that
                        live in the wild and there are snakes kept as pets. There are certain
                        characteristics that differentiate a pet from an animal living in the wild.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Dependent on Humans to Live – </strong> A pet needs to be given food, water,
                                and shelter by its owner. Being domesticated means the animal
                                depends on its owner for all of its care. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Lives in a Home – </strong> A pet lives in a home. Some pets such as parakeets
                                and hamsters live in cages. Alternatively, dogs and cats wander freely
                                around a home and may have their own bed to sleep in. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Needs a Veterinarian’s Care – </strong> Pets need care from a veterinarian. The type of healthcare a pet needs depends on what type of pet it is. An iguana and a beagle need completely different types of vet care! </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Some Pets Can Be Trained – </strong>A dog can learn how to sit, stay, and heel in a course of obedience training. Parrots can be taught to talk, and some cats can be taught by humans to do tricks.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Devoted to Its Owner  – </strong>Pets are often devoted to their owners. They can establish a trust with their owner over time. In fact, some pets want to be with their owners 24/7!</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Provides Companionship - </strong>A pet is meant to be a companion to its owner.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Pets are Different from a Therapy Animal -</strong> A therapy animal receives specific training in order to provide support and care to its owner. As an example, some therapy dogs are trained to recognize the signs of a seizure in their owner. The dog responds by trying to get the person to a safe place. Alternatively, a pet is there strictly as a companion.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Different from a Farm Animal –</strong>A cow or a chicken living on a farm serves a specific purpose. A cow provides milk while a chicken lays eggs to be eaten or sold. This makes farm animals a little different than traditional pets.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Can Be Common or Uncommon –</strong>When you think of a pet you probably picture a dog, a cat, a bird, a fish, or a gerbil. Those are common choices for pets. Some people prefer less common or exotic pets such as snakes, iguanas, spiders, and ferrets. As long as an owner can offer appropriate care, many animals can live happily as pets.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Cannot Survive in the Wild –</strong>One of the main characteristics separating pets from other animals is a pet can’t survive in the wild. It has been domesticated or raised under a person’s care. So, releasing a pet snake into the wild doesn’t mean it will know how to find food or shelter. In fact, it will likely die.</p>
                        </li>
                        <h3>How long do different types of pets live?</h3>
                        <li>
                            <p>Some pets live a very long time. For instance, some dogs live from 10 to 15 years depending on the breed. Cats can also live to be 15 years old or more.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Alternatively, some pets are known to live a relatively short time. For instance, betta fish may only live for three years. Hamsters live for just one to two years while guinea pigs can live from four to six years.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                            It’s best to research how long a particular type of pet is predicted to live before committing to its care. For instance, some parrots can live to be 50 years old! People who own animals that live a long time such as parrots and turtles must make arrangements for someone to care for the pet if necessary.
